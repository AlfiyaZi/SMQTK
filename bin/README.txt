Additional required binaries for various SMQTK system components:

- ffmpeg -> video metadata probing
- frame_extractor -> build by this repository but additionally requiring Boost
                     and VXL dependencies, this is optionally required for frame
                     extraction from video files
- colorDescriptor -> See the README.md in the directory above this.
