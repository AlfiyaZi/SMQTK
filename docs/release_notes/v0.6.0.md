SMQTK v0.6.0 Release Notes
==========================


Updates / New Features since v0.5.0
-----------------------------------

CMake

  * Added scripts that were missing from install command.

Descriptor Index

  * Changed functions that used to take ``*uuids`` list expansion as an
    argument and changed them to take iterables, which no longer causes
    sequencification of input iterables and is already compatible with all
    included implementations except Solr

  * Update Solr implementation functions that used to take ``*uuid`` list
    expansion to properly handle input iterables of arbitrary sizes.

  * DescriptorIndex instances, when iterated over, now yield DescriptorElement
    instances instead of just the UUID keys.

Utilities

  * Removed by-index access in ``elements_to_matrix``, allowing arbitrary input
    as long as the __len__ and __iter__ functions are defined.

Scripts

  * Simplified the ``train_itq.py`` script a little.


Fixes since v0.5.0
------------------

Descriptor Index

  * Fixed PostgreSQL backend bug when iterating over descriptors that caused
    inconsistent/duplicate elements in iterated values.

Utilities

  * Fixed bug in ``int_to_vector`` functions dealing with vector size
    estimation.

Web Apps

  * Fixed bugs in IQR classifier caching and refreshing from dirty state

  * Fixed how the NearestNeighbor service descriptor computation method errors
    regarding descriptor retrieval in order to not obfuscate the error.
