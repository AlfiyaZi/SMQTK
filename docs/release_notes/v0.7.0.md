SMQTK v0.7.0 Release Notes
==========================


Updates / New Features since v0.6.2
-----------------------------------

Build System

  * Added ``setup.py`` script in support of installation by ``pip``. Updated
    CMake code to install python components via this scripts.

Classifier Interface

  * Added default ``ClassificationElementFactory`` that uses the in-memory
    back-end.

Compute Functions

  * Added minibatch kmeans based descriptor clustering function.

Descriptor Elements

  * Revised implementation of in-memory representation, doing away with
    global cache.

  * Added optimization to Postgres backend for a slightly faster ``has_vector``
    implementation.

Descriptor Generator

  * Removed lingering assumption of ``pyflann`` module presence in
    ``colordescriptor.py``.

Docker

  * Revised default IQR service configuration file to take into account
    recently added session expiration support. Defaults were used before,
    but now it needs to be specifically enabled as by default expiration is
    not enabled.

Scripts

  * Add script to conveniently make Ball-tree hash index model given an
    existing ``hash2uuids.pickle`` model file required for the
    ``LSHNearestNeighborsIndex`` implementation.

  * ``compute_many_descriptor.py`` batch size parameter now defaulted to 0
    instead of 256.

  * Add script to cluster an index of descriptors via mini-batch kmeans
    (scikit-learn).

  * Added script wraping the use of the minibatch kmeans descriptor clustering
    function.

  * Added scripts and notebooks for retrieving Memex-specific data from
    Elasticsearch.

  * Moved-command line scripts to the `smqtk.bin` sub-module in order to use
    ``setuptool`` support for cross-platform executable generation.


Fixes since v0.6.2
------------------

Scripts

  * Fix logging bug in `compute_many_descriptors.py` when file path has unicode
    in it.

  * Removed final loop progress report from `compute_many_descriptors.py` as it
    did not report valid statistics.

  * Fixed deprecated import of ``flask-basicauth`` module.

Metrics

  * Fixed cosine distance function to return angular distance.
